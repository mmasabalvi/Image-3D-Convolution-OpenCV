# Image-3D-Convolution-OpenCV

This repo holds the program for image processing on grayscale images using OpenCv Library in C++. Multiple 3D Kernels are applied to a given 2D image to achieve blurring, edge detection, and feature extraction. 

The sample grayscale images are also part of the repo.

The code is very thorough, with relevant comments added to explain the entire procedure
